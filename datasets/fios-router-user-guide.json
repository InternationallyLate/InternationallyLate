The DHCP server provides a mechanism for allocating IP \naddresses to these hosts and for delivering network configuration \nparameters to the hosts.\nFor example, a client (host) sends a broadcast message on the \nnetwork requesting an IP address for itself. The DHCP server then checks its list of available addresses and leases a local IP \naddress to the host for a specific period of time and simultaneously \ndesignates this IP address as taken. At this point, the host is \nconfigured with an IP address for the duration of the lease.\nThe host can renew an expiring lease or let it expire. If it renews a \nlease, the host receives current information about network services, as it did during the original lease, allowing it to update its network \nconfigurations to re \ufb02 ect any changes that occurred since the first \nconnection to the network.\nIf the host wishes to terminate a lease before its expiration, it sends \na release message to the DHCP server. This makes the IP address \navailable for use by other hosts.\nThe DHCP server performs the following functions:\n\u2022 Displays a list of all DHCP host devices connected to your \nFios Router\n\u2022 Defines the range of IP addresses that can be allocated in the \nnetwork\n\u2022 Defines the length of time the dynamic IP addresses are \nallocated", "nEt WoRk SEttingS\n\u2022 Provides the above configurations for each network device and \ncan be configured and enabled or disabled separately for each \nnetwork device\n\u2022 Assigns a static lease to a network computer to receive the \nsame IP address each time it connects to the network, even if \nthis IP address is within the range of addresses that the DHCP \nserver may assign to other computer\n\u2022 Provides the DNS server with the host name and IP address of \neach computer connected to the network\nTo view a summary of the services provided by the DHCP server:\n1.
