            "content": "Based on your budget of $312.5 per month and being within the 55-64 age group, I would recommend the Verizon Do More Unlimited plan. \n\nThe Do More Unlimited plan is priced at $80 per month for a single line. It offers unlimited talk, text, and data with high-speed 4G LTE. Additionally, it includes premium data, meaning that you will get prioritized network access even during times of network congestion. \n\nThis plan also includes unlimited hotspot data, so you can use your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot for your other devices. It also offers 600GB of Verizon Cloud storage and access to the Disney+ streaming service for six months.\n\nFurthermore, this plan includes unlimited international texting to over 200 countries and discounted international calling rates. You will also have access to Verizon Up, which provides rewards and discounts on various services and products.\n\nOverall, the Verizon Do More Unlimited plan offers a robust package of features and benefits at a reasonable price. However, I recommend reaching out to Verizon directly or visiting a Verizon store to get more accurate and up-to-date information about available plans and any promotions that may be currently running."
